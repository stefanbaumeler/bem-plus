The bem-plus methodology is the foundation of this repository. As the name implies, it is based on the BEM methodology. While this repository will only work for you if you use the bem-plus methodology, the bem-plus methodology can be used without any code in this repository. As a methodology, it is only a set of rules and guidelines, independent of any code. In this directory, you will find the definition of the bem-plus methodologies, the rules thereof, examples and more:

- Refer to [the guide](guide/) if you are just getting started.
  - If you have experience working with BEM, you can skip Parts [1](guide/part-1) and [2](guide/part-1), and jump in at [Part 3](guide/part-3).
- Refer to [the reference](reference.md) for a full set of rules with explanations.
- Have a look at [the examples](examples/) to get a better feel of how this works in action.

For a bigger project that implements the bem-plus methodology (though none of the packages), you can have a look at [my portfolio](https://github.com/stefanbaumeler/portfolio/tree/main/src/styles).
