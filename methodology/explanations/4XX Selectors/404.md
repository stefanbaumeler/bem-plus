#404 The styles inside a modifier should be kept at a minimum. If a style can exist in the base class, it should be written there.

Modifiers can grow quite complex in certain scenarios, this rule aims to keep them as simple as possible, moving the complexity to the base class, making the whole element more understandable and helping to keep the nesting flat.

It is also easier to extend the code this way, because additional modifiers can now also access the code you moved from the first modifier to the base class.

❌ Discouraged
```scss
.button {
    color: #FFFFFF;

    &--light {
        color: #000000;

        &:before {
            content: '';
            position: absolute;
            width: 20px;
            height: 20px;
            top: 20px;
            left: 20px;
        }
    }
}
```

✅ Correct
```scss
.button {
    color: #FFFFFF;

    &:before {
        content: '';
        display: none;
        position: absolute;
        width: 20px;
        height: 20px;
        top: 20px;
        left: 20px;
    }

    &--light {
        color: #000000;

        &:before {
            display: block;
        }
    }

    &--red {
        color: #FF0000;

        // Other modifiers can now also use &:before!
        &:before {
            display: block;
        }
    }
}
```
