# 402 Blocks, elements and modifiers, as well as other selectors must not start with `-` or a number.

Some packages built for bem-plus aim to transform bem-plus element mixins into JavaScript classes, methods and variables. Because in JavaScript, such construct can't start with a number or a `-`, this is discouraged in bem-plus as well.

❌ Discouraged
```scss
.headline--1,
.-selector,
.header__3rd-col {

}
```

✅ Correct
```scss
.headline--level-1,
.selector,
.header__col-3 {

}
```
