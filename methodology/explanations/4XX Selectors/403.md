# 403 Whenever possible, classes should be used as selectors, not ids, tags or attributes.

This is because an ID, a class and, a tag and an attribute all have different specificities, so there are benefits in only using one of them. But which one?

- We can't only use IDs because IDs have to be unique.
- We can't use tags because we can't name tags.
- We can't use attributes because not all elements have attributes.

So classes it is.
