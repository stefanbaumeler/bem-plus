# 103 The file must be named the same as the block. A leading `_` is okay.

Like [Rule 202](102), this helps with orientation. If you have a glass of pickles you don't write onions on it. It is also expected by various packages built for bem-plus.

The `_` prefix is allowed because some people like to prefix partial scss files. This is [officially supported by SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#partials).
