# 303 All `@at-root` selectors should end with `&`.

`@at-root` allows you to break out of your nesting structure entirely. It allows you to write an SCSS selector as if you were writing it outside of the nesting you currently find yourself in. This rule forces you back into the nesting, meaning you can use `@at-root` to prefix any selector with a parent selector, but you can't select any random element outside of the current context.

Furthermore, ending an `@at-root` selector pseudo-selectors like `&:hover` or `&:before` is discouraged, instead, put the `@at-root` selector inside the pseudo-selector:

❌ Discouraged
```scss
.button {
    color: #000000;

    &:hover {
        color: #FF0000;
    }

    @at-root .body--blue &:hover {
        color: #0000FF;
    }
}
```

✅ Correct
```scss
.button {
    color: #000000;

    &:hover {
        color: #FF0000;

        @at-root .body--blue & {
            color: #0000FF;
        }
    }
}
```
