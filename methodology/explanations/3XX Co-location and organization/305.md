# 305 Do not overuse variables. Do not use variables to define other variables.

This rule applies to variables, but the reasoning is really a mixture of [Rule 104](304) and [Rule 106](../5XX%20Utility%20mixins/504)

Variables are very similar to utility mixins in that they abstract things, and by doing so, group things together. Do not group things together that do not change together. They also tend to increase complexity and move things around, which violates the "everything affecting an element should be declared in one place" principle, see [Rule 402](301)

Think of variables as global constants.
