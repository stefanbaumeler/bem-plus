# 502 `%` / `@extend` should not be used. Use utility mixins instead.

`@extend` / `%` and `@mixin` / `@include` solve the same problem in two different ways.

First off, it makes sense not to mix them. If they solve the same problem, picking one makes the code you write less complex.

Secondly, `@mixin` can do everything `@extend` is able to do, and more. `@mixin` supports parameters and `@content`, `@extend` does not. `@extend` is riddled with pitfalls and edge cases. Use `@mixin`.
