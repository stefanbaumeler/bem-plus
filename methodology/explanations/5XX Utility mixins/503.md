# 503 Utility mixins should not contain selectors or media queries. Instead, create multiple utility mixins.

Utility mixins should be designed with reusability in mind. Using media queries and especially selectors in utility mixins makes them less flexible, because the element using the utility mixin now also has to follow this exact structure of selectors.

❌ Discouraged
```scss
@mixin hover-animation {
    transition: color .25s;
    color: #000000;

    &:hover {
        color: #333333;
    }

    &--light {
        color: #FFFFFF;

        &:hover {
            color: #CCCCCC;
        }
    }
}
.button {
    @include hover-animation;
}

.link {
    // What if the "link--light" styles should be used by "link--secondary"?
    @include hover-animation;
}
```

✅ Correct
```scss
@mixin hover-animation-dark {
    transition: color .25s;
    color: #000000;

    &:hover {
        color: #333333;
    }
}

@mixin hover-animation-light {
    transition: color .25s;
    color: #000000;

    &:hover {
        color: #CCCCCC;
    }
}

.button {
    @include hover-animation-dark;

    &--light {
        @include hover-animation-light;
    }
}

.link {
    @include hover-animation-dark;

    // no problems here!
    &--secondary {
        @include hover-animation-light;
    }
}
```

This example still uses the `&:hover` selector inside the utility mixin. This is usually fine, but for maximum flexibility, you might want to extract those styles into their own utility mixins as well. But be aware that you trade increased flexibility for increased complexity here. This rule is a spectrum. Use common sense.

```scss
@mixin hover-animation-dark {
    transition: color .25s;
    color: #000000;
}

@mixin hover-animation-dark-hover {
    color: #333333;
}

@mixin hover-animation-light {
    transition: color .25s;
    color: #000000;
}

@mixin hover-animation-light-hover {
    color: #CCCCCC;
}

.button {
    @include hover-animation-dark;

    &:hover {
        @include hover-animation-dark-hover;
    }

    &--light {
        @include hover-animation-light;

        &:hover {
            @include hover-animation-light-hover;
        }
    }
}
```
