# 501 Utility classes should not be used. Use utility mixins or modifiers instead.

While there are approaches to writing CSS that embrace and encourage writing utility classes, like Tailwind CSS, it goes against everything bem-plus stands for. By design, any CSS styles you write should belong to a block, its elements or its modifiers.

If you use utility classes, especially in concert with a system like bem-plus that is not built to handle them, you inevitably introduce specificity issues.

In simple cases you can replace the utility class with a modifier:

❌ Discouraged
```scss
.button {
    color: #FF0000;

    .green {
        color: #00FF00;
    }
}
```

✅ Correct
```scss
.button {
    color: #FF0000;

    &--green {
        color: #00FF00;
    }
}
```

But what if that green color example in reality consists of a dozen lines of code, and you use that `.green` utility class in ten places? In this case `.green` might not even be nested in `.button` it might be "its own thing". Here we should create a utility mixin. This utility mixin should only contain styles, not selectors. This way, the components using it can decide for themselves, what selector those styles should apply to.

❌ Discouraged
```scss
.button {
    color: #FF0000;
}

.other {
    color: #0000FF;
}

.green {
    color: #00FF00;
}
```
Usage:
```html
<button class="button green"></button>
<div class="other green"></div>
```

✅ Correct
```scss
@mixin green {
    color: #00FF00;
}

.button {
    color: #FF0000;

    &--green {
        @include green;
    }
}

.other {
    color: #0000FF;

    &--green {
        @include green;
    }
}
```
