# 504 Utility mixins can include other utility mixins, but do not go beyond 3 layers.

This rule aims to avoid overly complex "chains" of utility mixins. Centralizing styles in the elements they belong to is a primary goal of bem-plus. This way, if you have to change this element, you know you see everything that affects it in one place, and if you change it, you can be confident that your change does not affect any other elements. Utility mixins work against that. Because they can be incredibly useful, they are allowed, but if your utility mixin calls another utility mixin, and that utility mixin calls yet another one, the styles belonging to the original element, where you called the first utility mixin are spread all over and keeping track of all the things a change might affect can become very tricky.
