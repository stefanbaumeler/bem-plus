# 703 Parameters of an element mixin must not be used to transfer information from the call-site. The parameters are used by bem-plus packages.

There are two reasons why element mixin parameters should be avoided:

- Element mixins are static by design. They should only ever be called once, in the index. Because of this, any parameters would always be the same, constant. This means you can simply replace the parameter with the actual value.
- Some packages built for bem-plus use the parameters of element mixins for unrelated functionality.

Generally speaking: If a bem-plus package doesn't tell you to use element mixin parameters, don't.

Passing parameters to utility mixins and functions is fine.

❌ Discouraged
```scss
@mixin header-root($color) {
    color: $color
}

@mixin header {
    .header {
        @include header-root($color: #FF0000)
    }
}
```

✅ Correct
```scss
@mixin header-root {
    color: #FF0000;
}

@mixin header {
    .header {
        @include header-root;
    }
}
```
