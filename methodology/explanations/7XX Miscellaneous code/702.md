# 702 When breaking with bem-plus convention is unavoidable, like when working with third party libraries, those styles must be kept separate from the rest of the application.

You might encounter a situation where you have to style selectors you have no control over. This is quite common when working with third party libraries, for example [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview?hl=de) or [plyr](https://plyr.io/).

In this case you must keep those style declarations separate from the code you write using bem-plus, otherwise it might interfere with some packages built for bem-plus.

It is recommended to create an SCSS file per library, for example `plyr.scss`, and put them into a folder like `/styles/lib`.
