# 704 The order of things inside an element mixin should follow a predictable pattern, from most related to the element, to least related.

The recommended order is as follows:

- Including mixins like `@include font(16, 20);`
- Styles like `display: block;`
- `@media` breakpoint queries or mixins that facilitate breakpoints (e.g. `@include breakpoint(large) {}`)
- Other `@media` queries like `@media print`
- State selectors like `:hover` and `:focus`
- Pseudo elements like `:before` and `:after`
- Modifiers like `&--active`

Including mixins is at the top because you might want to override included styles with styles below. The rest of the order is meant to represent relevance to the class in question:
- Styles directly affect the element, so they're at the top.
- Media queries affect the element, but only when certain conditions are met.
- Pseudo elements are essentially separate elements attached to the class in question
- Modifiers are completely separate classes

State selectors, pseudo elements and modifiers can also grow quite large, including their own mixins, media breakpoints, or other selectors. Putting them towards the end prevents you from missing a media query "hidden" below all the other things at the end of the selector.
